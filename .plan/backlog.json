Extracts problem, solution, target customer, value prop, timing, business model hypothesis.\n\n**`/pro:product.validate`** - Run brutal, no-BS market validation against the brief. Acts like a harsh technical co-founder who destroys weak ideas but confirms strong ones. Uses multi-source research (WebSearch built-in, extensible to Perplexity/Gemini). Produces comprehensive validation report with: market signal analysis, gap analysis, buyer psychology, competitive reality, risk profile, and GO/CAUTION/NO-GO verdict.\n\n**`/pro:product.pitch`** - Generate pitch deck outline from validated product. Uses brief + validation to create 10-slide structure with hook, problem, solution, market, business model, traction, competition, team, ask, and vision.\n\n**Storage:** `.plan/product/` directory with timestamped versioning\n**Git required:** No - works in any directory, even pre-repo\n**Tone:** Brutally honest, not cruel\n**Research APIs:** Extension hooks for Perplexity/Gemini in v1",
