## Bundled MCP Servers

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Playwright** | Browser automation for visual verification |
| **Context7** | Up-to-date documentation for any library |
| **Supabase** | Local database operations (requires setup) |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Browser debugging, performance analysis, and automation |
| **Figma** | Figma design file access and integration |
| **Notion** | Read and write to Notion workspaces (OAuth required) |
| **shadcn-ui** | Access shadcn/ui v4 components, blocks, and implementations |
| **Ollama** | Delegate tasks to local LLMs (embeddings, text generation) |

### Shell Configuration (Optional MCP Servers)

Some MCP servers require environment variables. Add these to your shell config (`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`).

#### GitHub Token

```bash
# Optional: increases shadcn-ui rate limit from 60 to 5000/hr
export GITHUB_TOKEN='ghp_your_token_here'
```

#### Supabase Service Role Key

The Supabase MCP requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Choose one approach:

**Option A: Quick (Recommended)**

Add this function to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:

```bash
# Load Supabase key from running local instance
load_supabase_key() {
  local out
  out="$(supabase status --output json 2>/dev/null)"
  [[ -n "$out" ]] && export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="$(echo "$out" | jq -r '.SERVICE_ROLE_KEY // empty')"
}
```

Run `load_supabase_key` after starting a local Supabase instance.

**Option B: Cached (faster shell startup)**

For users who open many terminal sessions, this approach caches the key to avoid calling `supabase status` on every shell startup:

```bash
# Supabase service role key with caching (refreshes hourly)
_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE="$HOME/.cache/supabase_service_role_key"

load_supabase_key() {
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE")"

  # Use cache if fresh (<1 hour old)
  if [[ -f "$_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE" ]]; then
    local age=$(( $(date +%s) - $(stat -f %m "$_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE" 2>/dev/null || stat -c %Y "$_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE" 2>/dev/null) ))
    if (( age < 3600 )); then
      export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="$(cat "$_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE")"
      return
    fi
  fi

  # Refresh from supabase status
  local key
  key="$(supabase status --output json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.SERVICE_ROLE_KEY // empty')"
  [[ -n "$key" ]] && echo "$key" > "$_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE"
  export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="$key"
}

# Load from cache at shell startup (fast)
[[ -f "$_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE" ]] && export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="$(cat "$_SUPABASE_KEY_CACHE")"
```

After starting Supabase for the first time, run `load_supabase_key` to populate the cache.

---

After adding, restart your shell or run `source ~/.zshrc`.

**Note:** If these env vars are not set, you'll see warnings in `/plugin` UI. The plugin still works - only those specific MCP servers will be unavailable.

### Playwright Setup

By default, the plugin uses standard [@playwright/mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) which launches a **headless** Chrome instance for browser automation. This means no browser window will pop up while you're working.

**To show the browser** (useful for debugging):
```bash
export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADED=1
```

**Alternative: playwriter (Chrome extension-based)**

[playwriter](https://github.com/remorses/playwriter) offers an alternative approach using a Chrome extension instead of launching a separate browser:

- Uses 90% less context window with a single `execute` tool
- Works in your existing browser session (preserves extensions, logins)
- Enables collaboration between user and AI on the same page
- Requires manual Chrome extension installation

To switch to playwriter:

```bash
# Set environment variable before starting Claude Code
export USE_PLAYWRITER=1
```

**playwriter setup:**
1. Install the [playwriter Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/playwriter) and pin it to your toolbar
2. Click the extension icon on tabs you want to automate (turns green when connected)
3. Set `USE_PLAYWRITER=1` in your environment
4. Restart Claude Code

The wrapper automatically enables `PLAYWRITER_AUTO_ENABLE` for automatic initial tab creation.

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Standard Playwright | playwriter |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Browser instance | Standalone Chrome | Your existing browser |
| Extensions | None | Your installed extensions |
| Context window | ~17 tools | Single `execute` tool |
| Setup | Works out of box | Requires extension install |
| Detection bypass | Limited | Can disconnect for login |

### Supabase Setup

Use `/pro:supabase.local` to initialize and manage local Supabase instances with unique ports per project.

The Supabase MCP requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your environment. See [Shell Configuration](#shell-configuration-optional-mcp-servers) to set up the `load_supabase_key` function, then run it after `supabase start`.

### shadcn-ui Setup

The shadcn-ui MCP works out of the box but benefits from a GitHub token for higher rate limits (5000 vs 60 requests/hour). See [Shell Configuration](#shell-configuration-optional-mcp-servers) for setup.

The server provides access to shadcn/ui v4 components across React, Vue, Svelte, and React Native frameworks.

### Notion Setup

The Notion MCP works like Figma - first invocation triggers an OAuth authorization flow in your browser. Grant access to the workspaces you want Claude to read/write.

**Limitation:** Image and file uploads are not yet supported (on Notion's roadmap).

### Ollama Setup

The Ollama MCP enables Claude to delegate tasks to local LLMs running via [Ollama](https://ollama.com). This provides capabilities Claude doesn't have natively (embeddings) and can save tokens by offloading simple tasks to smaller models.

**Prerequisites:**
- Ollama installed and running (`brew install ollama && brew services start ollama`)
- Node.js v16+

**Available Tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ollama_generate` | Text generation with a model |
| `ollama_chat` | Multi-turn conversation |
| `ollama_embed` | Generate vector embeddings |
| `ollama_list` | List available models |
| `ollama_ps` | Show running models |
| `ollama_pull` | Download a model |

**Recommended Models:**

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text    # Embeddings (274 MB)
ollama pull llama3.2:1b         # Fast simple tasks (1.3 GB)
ollama pull qwen3-coder         # Code generation (18 GB)
```

**Practical Use Cases:**

1. **Generate Embeddings** - Use `ollama_embed` with `nomic-embed-text` for semantic search, document similarity, or building a knowledge base. Claude doesn't natively generate embeddings.

2. **Delegate Simple Tasks** - Offload routine work like writing docstrings to `llama3.2:1b`, reserving Claude's context for complex reasoning.

3. **Summarize Large Documents** - Use `ollama_generate` to summarize lengthy files locally, then send only the summary to Claude.

4. **Generate Boilerplate** - Delegate repetitive code generation to `qwen3-coder`, with Claude reviewing the output.

5. **Multi-Model Workflows** - Local models handle volume; Claude handles nuance and review.

**If Ollama isn't installed or running**, the tools will fail with a connection error when invoked. Start Ollama with `brew services start ollama` or verify it's running with `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`.

## Bounty Hunting Pipeline

Automate OSS bounty discovery, triage, and execution:

```
/pro:bounty.scout → TAKE/SKIP decision → /pro:bounty.hunter → PR submitted
```

### Two-Command Architecture

**Scout** (research-only):
- Fetches bounties from Algora.io
- Applies scoring heuristics based on maintainer signals
- Returns top candidate with TAKE/SKIP recommendation
- Zero side effects (safe to run repeatedly)

**Hunter** (full execution):
- Requires `gh auth login` first
- Posts `/attempt` comment on selected bounty
- Forks repository and creates spike branch
- Generates planning artifacts (scope, risks, implementation order)
- Implements minimal, merge-safe MVP
- Opens PR with human checkpoint before final submission

### Scoring Heuristics

Bounties are evaluated for mergeability, not just difficulty:

**Positive signals**: Clear maintainer guidance, isolated module, existing PRs incomplete/misaligned, well-defined acceptance criteria

**Negative signals**: Strong PR near merge, maintainer endorsing another solution, core/security/crypto code, high ambiguity, broad refactors required

### Human Checkpoint

The hunter command pauses before or after PR creation for review:
- Diff summary and risk assessment
- Mergeability rationale (maintainer perspective)
- Options: approve, adjust, or abort

### State Persistence

Results stored in `.plan/bounty-hunter/`:
- `discovered.json` - Cached bounty listings
- `attempts.json` - Record of claimed bounties and their status
- `config.json` - User preferences (floor amount, language filters)

### Usage

```bash
# Quick research pass
/pro:bounty.scout

# Full execution when ready
/pro:bounty.hunter
```

**Goal**: Compress the search → decision → implementation loop from hours to minutes.

## Product Validation Pipeline

A three-command pipeline for early-stage idea validation:

```
Raw Idea → /pro:product.brief → /pro:product.validate → /pro:product.pitch
```

### The Harsh Co-Founder

`/pro:product.validate` acts like a brutal but fair technical co-founder:
- Destroys weak ideas with evidence-based criticism
- Confirms strong ideas with clear GO signal
- Uses deep web research to back every claim
- Produces GO / CAUTION / NO-GO verdict

### Works Pre-Repo

These commands work in any directory, even before git init:
- Perfect for validating ideas before committing to a project
- Storage at `.plan/product/` with timestamped versioning
- Brief, validation reports, and pitch outlines all persist for reference

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Dump your unstructured idea
/pro:product.brief "I want to build a TurboTax for energy rebates..."

# 2. Get brutal market validation
/pro:product.validate

# 3. Generate pitch deck outline (if validated)
/pro:product.pitch
```

## Bundled Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **frontend-design** | Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Automatically used when building web components, pages, dashboards, or styling any web UI. |
| **build-in-public** | Automatically surface notable development moments and draft shareable content for X and LinkedIn. Proposes posts when features ship, bugs are solved, milestones are reached, design decisions are made, or learnings are discovered. |
| **content-retriever** | Reliably retrieve any public web content from URLs. Handles X, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, and blogs with platform-aware extraction. Uses tiered fallback (WebFetch → Playwright → user paste) for maximum reliability. Silent on success, reports only on deviation. |
| **product-brief** | Transform unstructured idea material into structured product briefs. Handles voice transcriptions, notes, or stream-of-consciousness input. Produces versioned briefs ready for validation. |

Skills are automatically available when the plugin is installed. Claude uses them when relevant to your task.

> The `frontend-design` skill is sourced from [Anthropic's skills repository](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) (Apache 2.0).

## Bundled Subagents

| Subagent | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **build-in-public** | Runs proactively after feature completions, bug fixes, PRs, and milestones to surface shareable content. |

Subagents appear in `/agents` alongside your custom agents. They run automatically when Claude detects relevant moments.

### Build in Public

The `build-in-public` subagent + skill work together:

- **Subagent** runs proactively after completing features, fixing bugs, creating PRs, or reaching milestones
- **Skill** provides detailed instructions for drafting platform-specific content

When notable moments occur, content is proposed inline:
- Feature shipped
- Bug solved
- Milestone reached
- Design decision made
- Learning discovered

You can approve, edit, defer, or skip. Use `/pro:bip` to review your pending queue.

**Voice calibration:** Run `/pro:bip.setup` to configure your tone. Choose from presets (casual-technical, professional, minimal, storyteller, teacher) or provide example posts to match your style.
