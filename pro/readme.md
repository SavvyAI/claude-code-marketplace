## Workflow

```
# Feature development
/pro:feature "add CSV export"   # Plan and start
/pro:backlog.resume             # Resume later
/pro:audit                      # Full audit (quality + security)
/pro:audit.quality              # Quick completeness check
/pro:audit.security             # Security-only scan
/pro:pr                         # Create PR
/pro:pr.resolve                 # Address feedback
/pro:pr.merged                  # Clean up

# Bug fixes
/pro:bug "login fails silently" # Capture, investigate, fix

# Exploratory work
/pro:spike "evaluate auth libs" # Time-boxed exploration

# Maintenance work
/pro:chore "update deps"        # Infra, docs, tests, deps, CI

# Spec ingestion (lossless PRD/spec handling)
/pro:spec.import <paste spec>   # Persist spec, auto-parse to backlog
/pro:spec                       # View imported specs
/pro:spec spec-001              # View specific spec details

# Backlog management
/pro:roadmap                    # See project status
/pro:backlog                    # Pick items (or resume in-progress)
/pro:backlog.add "add retry"    # Add item manually
/pro:backlog.resume             # Resume in-progress work

# Git utilities
/pro:git.main                   # Standardize default branch to 'main'

# Product validation (pre-repo, idea stage)
/pro:product.brief "idea here"  # Distill chaos into structured brief
/pro:product.validate           # Brutal market validation
/pro:product.pitch              # Generate pitch deck outline
```

## Bundled MCP Servers

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Playwright** | Browser automation for visual verification |
| **Context7** | Up-to-date documentation for any library |
| **Supabase** | Local database operations (requires setup) |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Browser debugging, performance analysis, and automation |
| **Figma** | Figma design file access and integration |
| **shadcn-ui** | Access shadcn/ui v4 components, blocks, and implementations |

### Supabase Setup

Use `/pro:supabase.local` to initialize and manage local Supabase instances with unique ports per project.

The Supabase MCP requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your environment:

```bash
# Get your key from a running local Supabase instance
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=$(supabase status -o json | jq -r '.SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')
```

### shadcn-ui Setup

The shadcn-ui MCP works out of the box but benefits from a GitHub token for higher rate limits (5000 vs 60 requests/hour):

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

The server provides access to shadcn/ui v4 components across React, Vue, Svelte, and React Native frameworks.

## Product Validation Pipeline

A three-command pipeline for early-stage idea validation:

```
Raw Idea → /pro:product.brief → /pro:product.validate → /pro:product.pitch
```

### The Harsh Co-Founder

`/pro:product.validate` acts like a brutal but fair technical co-founder:
- Destroys weak ideas with evidence-based criticism
- Confirms strong ideas with clear GO signal
- Uses deep web research to back every claim
- Produces GO / CAUTION / NO-GO verdict

### Works Pre-Repo

These commands work in any directory, even before git init:
- Perfect for validating ideas before committing to a project
- Storage at `.plan/product/` with timestamped versioning
- Brief, validation reports, and pitch outlines all persist for reference

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Dump your unstructured idea
/pro:product.brief "I want to build a TurboTax for energy rebates..."

# 2. Get brutal market validation
/pro:product.validate

# 3. Generate pitch deck outline (if validated)
/pro:product.pitch
```

## Bundled Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **frontend-design** | Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Automatically used when building web components, pages, dashboards, or styling any web UI. |
| **build-in-public** | Automatically surface notable development moments and draft shareable content for X and LinkedIn. Proposes posts when features ship, bugs are solved, milestones are reached, design decisions are made, or learnings are discovered. |

Skills are automatically available when the plugin is installed. Claude uses them when relevant to your task.

> The `frontend-design` skill is sourced from [Anthropic's skills repository](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) (Apache 2.0).

## Bundled Subagents

| Subagent | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **build-in-public** | Runs proactively after feature completions, bug fixes, PRs, and milestones to surface shareable content. |

Subagents appear in `/agents` alongside your custom agents. They run automatically when Claude detects relevant moments.

### Build in Public

The `build-in-public` subagent + skill work together:

- **Subagent** runs proactively after completing features, fixing bugs, creating PRs, or reaching milestones
- **Skill** provides detailed instructions for drafting platform-specific content

When notable moments occur, content is proposed inline:
- Feature shipped
- Bug solved
- Milestone reached
- Design decision made
- Learning discovered

You can approve, edit, defer, or skip. Use `/pro:bip` to review your pending queue.

**Voice calibration:** Run `/pro:bip.setup` to configure your tone. Choose from presets (casual-technical, professional, minimal, storyteller, teacher) or provide example posts to match your style.
