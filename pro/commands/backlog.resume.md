## Context

Smart "next action" command that either resumes in-progress work or recommends the next highest priority item from the backlog.

## Your Task

### 1. Check for in-progress work

Read `.plan/backlog.json` and filter items with `status: "in-progress"`.

**If in-progress items exist:**

- If single item → Resume it (go to step 3)
- If multiple items → Present list and ask which to resume

**If NO in-progress items:**

- Continue to step 2 (recommend next item)

### 2. Recommend next item from backlog

If no work is in progress, show the backlog with the highest priority item pre-selected:

1. Filter items with `status: "open"`
2. Sort by severity (critical > high > medium > low), then by `createdAt` (oldest first)
3. Pre-select the top item as the recommended choice
4. Present using `AskUserQuestion`:

   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  No work in progress. Recommended next:                 │
   │                                                         │
   │  [●] [Security] [critical] Fix API key exposure         │
   │  [ ] [Bug]      [high]     Payment timeout issue        │
   │  [ ] [Tests]    [medium]   Add auth flow tests          │
   │  [ ] [Feature]  [low]      Dark mode support            │
   │                                                         │
   │  ● = Recommended (highest priority)                     │
   │                                                         │
   │  Accept recommendation or choose differently.           │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

5. Enable `multiSelect: true` so user can pick multiple related items
6. User can:
   - Accept the pre-selected recommendation
   - Select different item(s)
   - Select additional items along with recommendation

7. Once selected, create branch and begin work (same as `/pro:backlog` step 6)

### 3. Resume in-progress work

For the selected in-progress item:

1. **Switch to the work branch**
   - Get branch from the backlog item (check `sourceBranch` or infer from planning directory)
   - Check if branch exists locally: `git branch --list {branch}`
   - If exists, switch to it: `git checkout {branch}`
   - If not, check remote and create tracking branch

2. **Gather context**
   - Read planning notes from `.plan/{branch-name}/`
   - Read recent git history: `git log --oneline -10`
   - Check for uncommitted changes: `git status`
   - Review the backlog item's description and requirements

3. **Present status summary**

   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  Resuming: #1 - [Title]                                 │
   │  Branch: feat/example-branch                            │
   │                                                         │
   │  Planning notes: .plan/feat-example-branch/             │
   │  Last commit: abc1234 - "Add initial implementation"    │
   │  Uncommitted changes: 3 files modified                  │
   │                                                         │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

4. **Continue work**
   - Read and follow the planning notes
   - Resume implementation where it left off
   - Use the todo list to track remaining tasks

## Priority Sort Order

1. **Severity** (descending): critical > high > medium > low
2. **Age** (ascending): oldest items first (by `createdAt`)

## Browser Verification

For web applications, use Playwright MCP (if available) rather than screenshots for:
- Visual verification and UI state inspection
- Console log and error analysis
- Network request inspection

## Definition of Done

- If in-progress: Switched to branch, context gathered, ready to continue
- If new work: Branch created, items marked in-progress, plan mode entered
