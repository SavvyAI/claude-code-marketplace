# README Generator & Beautifier

Create or update a README with explicit control over beautification. Supports two modes: full beautification for elite open-source quality, or light cleanup that preserves existing structure.

## Context

Target README: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to `./README.md` if not specified)

## Your Task

### Phase 1: Discovery

Analyze the project to understand the current state.

#### 1.1 Locate README Files

Search for README files in the project:

- `README.md`, `readme.md`, `README`, `README.txt` in project root
- README files in subdirectories (for monorepos)

Determine the target:
- If argument specifies a path, use that
- If only root README exists, use that
- If multiple READMEs exist and no argument, ask user which to target

#### 1.2 Detect Project Type

Analyze project metadata:

- **Package managers:** `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`
- **Project category:** CLI tool, library, web application, API, monorepo
- **Tech stack:** Languages, frameworks, key dependencies
- **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`
- **Quality tools:** Test frameworks, coverage config, linters

#### 1.3 Analyze Existing README (if updating)

If a README exists, analyze:

- Current section structure
- Existing badges (URLs, types, validity)
- Links present (internal and external)
- Overall quality and completeness
- Areas that could be improved

#### 1.4 Gather Metadata

Collect from project files:

- Repository name and description
- License type
- Version information
- Maintainer/author info
- Contributing guidelines presence
- Changelog existence

**Report findings to user before proceeding.**

---

### Phase 2: Mode Selection

Present the user with a clear choice between modes.

#### For Existing README

```
📄 README Mode Selection

Your README currently has:
• [X] sections
• [Y] badges
• [Z] links

How would you like to proceed?

1. **Beautify** - Full enhancement
   Transform into a polished, modern README with curated badges,
   strong visual hierarchy, and confident language.
   ⚠️ May significantly change the current format.

2. **Preserve Structure** - Light cleanup only
   Keep your current layout. Only fix broken links,
   update outdated info, and make minor clarity improvements.
```

- Require explicit selection (no default for existing READMEs)
- Explain implications clearly

#### For New README (no existing file)

```
📄 Creating New README

No README.md found in this project.

Recommendation: **Beautify mode** for new READMEs.

This will create a polished, professional README with:
• Strong visual hierarchy
• Relevant badges for your project type
• Clear sections for installation, usage, and more

Proceed with Beautify mode?
```

- Recommend Beautify but still require confirmation

---

### Phase 3: Validation

Before making changes, validate the current state.

#### 3.1 Badge Validation

For each badge in the existing README:

1. Extract the badge image URL
2. Use `WebFetch` to check if it returns a valid image
3. Identify:
   - ✅ Working badges
   - ❌ Broken badges (404, error responses)
   - ⚠️ Outdated badges (e.g., old version numbers)

#### 3.2 Link Validation

For all links in the README:

1. **Internal links:** Check if files/anchors exist
2. **External links:** Use `WebFetch` to verify they resolve
3. Categorize:
   - ✅ Working links
   - ❌ Broken links (404)
   - ↪️ Redirected links (may need updating)

#### 3.3 Present Findings

Show the user what was found:

```
🔍 Validation Results

Badges:
• 3 working
• 1 broken: [shields.io badge returning 404]
• 1 outdated: [version badge shows v1.0, current is v2.3]

Links:
• 12 working
• 2 broken:
  - ./docs/api.md (file not found)
  - https://old-docs.example.com (404)

What would you like to do with broken items?
```

**Get user decision for each broken item:**
- 🔧 Fix (provide correct URL)
- 🗑️ Remove
- ⏭️ Ignore

---

### Phase 4: Content Generation

Generate or update content based on selected mode.

#### 4.1 Beautify Mode

**Section Structure** (adapt to project type):

| Section | When to Include | Priority |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Title + Tagline | Always | Required |
| Badges | When relevant | High |
| Overview | Always | Required |
| Features | For apps/tools with multiple features | Medium |
| Installation | Always for installable projects | Required |
| Quick Start | When usage isn't obvious | High |
| Usage/Examples | Always | Required |
| Configuration | When configurable | Medium |
| API Reference | For libraries | Depends |
| Contributing | When accepting contributions | Medium |
| License | Always | Required |

**Badge Strategy:**

Propose badges based on project detection:

| Project Has | Suggest Badge |
|-------------|---------------|
| `package.json` | npm version |
| GitHub Actions | CI status |
| LICENSE file | License badge |
| Coverage config | Coverage badge |
| TypeScript | TypeScript badge |
| Published package | Downloads badge |

**Show each proposed badge and require approval:**

```
📛 Badge Recommendations

Based on your project, I recommend these badges:

1. ✅ npm version - [preview image]
   Shows current published version

2. ✅ CI Status - [preview image]
   Shows GitHub Actions build status

3. ❌ Coverage - Not detected
   Add coverage reporting to enable

Add these badges? [Yes to all / Review each / Skip badges]
```

**Content Quality:**

- Tighten language (remove filler, weak phrases)
- Use active voice
- Ensure consistent heading hierarchy
- Standardize code block formatting
- Add visual structure (spacing, horizontal rules where appropriate)
- Remove redundancy and clutter

#### 4.2 Preserve Mode

**Keep existing structure intact:**

- Same sections in same order
- Same heading styles
- Same overall format

**Apply only:**

- Broken link fixes (as approved in Phase 3)
- Outdated version numbers
- Factual corrections
- Minor grammar/clarity improvements
- Badge fixes only if explicitly approved

**Do NOT:**

- Reorder sections
- Change heading styles
- Add new sections
- Rewrite content for style
- Add badges without explicit request

1. Re-validate all links in the new README
2. Confirm no new broken links introduced
3. Verify markdown renders correctly

#### 6.3 Summary Report

```
✅ README Updated Successfully

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| No README and no project context | Ask user for project description before generating |
| Network unavailable for validation | Skip live validation, warn user, proceed with syntax checks only |
| User declines all changes | Exit gracefully with "No changes made" message |
| Validation finds many broken links | Warn user, offer to proceed or abort |
| Write permission denied | Report error clearly, suggest remediation |

---
