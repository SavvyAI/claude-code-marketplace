## Context

Let's create a pitch deck outline.

## Purpose

Generate a structured pitch deck outline from your validated product. Uses the product brief and validation report to create an investor-ready 10-slide structure.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Product brief exists (`.plan/product/brief.md`)
2. Validation report exists (`.plan/product/validation-*.md`)

**This command produces:**
- 10-slide pitch deck outline at `.plan/product/pitch-{timestamp}.md`
- Content derived from validation research
- Placeholder sections for user-specific info (team, ask)

## Your Task

### Step 1: Resolve Inputs

Find required documents:

1. **Brief:** Look for `.plan/product/brief.md`
2. **Validation:** Find most recent `.plan/product/validation-*.md`

If either is missing:
```
Error: Cannot generate pitch without validation.

Required files:
- .plan/product/brief.md (run /pro:product.brief)
- .plan/product/validation-*.md (run /pro:product.validate)
```

### Step 2: Check Validation Verdict

Read the validation report's verdict:

- **GO:** Proceed with enthusiastic pitch framing
- **CAUTION:** Proceed but acknowledge risks clearly
- **NO-GO:** Warn user before proceeding

For NO-GO:
```
Warning: The validation verdict was NO-GO.

Creating a pitch deck for an invalidated idea is risky. The validation identified these critical issues:
1. [Issue 1]
2. [Issue 2]
3. [Issue 3]

Do you want to proceed anyway? This pitch will need to address these concerns directly.
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm if NO-GO.

### Step 3: Extract Key Content

From the brief and validation, extract:

| Slide | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Hook | Core Insight from validation |
| Problem | Problem Statement + Market Signal |
| Solution | Proposed Solution from brief |
| Market | Market Signal + Buyer Analysis |
| Business Model | Business Model section |
| Traction | Evidence from validation research |
| Competition | Competitive Reality section |
| Team | [User fills in] |
| Ask | [User fills in] |
| Vision | Core Insight + Defensibility |

### Step 4: Generate Pitch Deck Outline

```

## Slide Design Notes

The outline is content-focused, not design-focused. When creating actual slides:

- **One idea per slide**
- **Minimal text** - these are talking points, not scripts
- **Visual hierarchy** - most important info largest
- **Data visualization** - charts > tables > text
- **Consistent branding** - but that's for the user to add

## Non-Git Directory Support

Works in any directory without git.

## Definition of Done

- Brief and validation files found
- Validation verdict checked (warn if NO-GO)
- Key content extracted from both documents
- 10-slide outline generated
- User-input sections clearly marked
- Pitch written with timestamp
- Pitch copied to clipboard
- Summary displayed with next steps
