The pull request: $ARGUMENTS was successfully merged and closed.

## Your Task

1. **Check for ADRs** - If ADRs were NOT created during `/pro:pr`, create them now (see ADR instructions below).
2. Switch to the main branch.
3. Pull latest changes.
4. Delete the merged feature branch (local and remote).
5. Clear the conversation.

## ADR Instructions (if not already created)

Architecture Decision Records capture the "why" behind implementation choices for future reference.

### Step 1: Check if ADRs already exist

Read `.plan/adr-index.json` and check if an entry exists for the merged branch. If ADRs already exist for this branch, skip to cleanup.

### Step 2: Setup (if needed)

Create directory and files if they don't exist:

1. Create `doc/decisions/` directory
2. Create `doc/decisions/README.md`:

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical decisions.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of an architecturally significant choice.

## Format

We use the [Michael Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Naming Convention

- Filename: `NNN-kebab-case-title.md` (e.g., `001-use-localStorage-for-tracking.md`)
- NNN = zero-padded sequence number (001, 002, 003...)
- Title in heading must match: `# NNN. Title` (e.g., `# 001. Use localStorage for Tracking`)

## Index

<!-- New ADRs added below -->
```

3. Create `.plan/adr-index.json` (if not exists):

```json
{
  "lastSequence": 0,
  "entries": []
}
```

### Step 3: Determine next ADR number

- Read `lastSequence` from `.plan/adr-index.json`
- Next number = lastSequence + 1

### Step 4: Extract decisions

Review the following to identify architectural decisions:
- `.plan/.done/{branch-name}/` archived planning documents
- Recent commits on main from the merged PR

Look for decisions about:
- Technology/library choices
- Data storage approaches
- API design patterns
- Architecture patterns
- Trade-offs made
- Rejected alternatives

### Step 5: Create ADRs

For each decision, create `doc/decisions/{NNN}-{kebab-case-title}.md`:

```markdown
# {NNN}. {Title}

Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Status

Accepted

## Context

{What problem or situation prompted this decision?}

## Decision

{What did we decide to do?}

## Consequences

{What are the positive and negative outcomes?}

## Alternatives Considered

{What options were evaluated? Why rejected?}

## Related

- Planning: `.plan/.done/{branch-name}/`
```

### Step 6: Update tracking files

1. Update `.plan/adr-index.json`:
   - Set `lastSequence` to highest ADR number created
   - Add entry: `{"branch": "{branch-name}", "adrs": ["NNN-title.md", ...]}`

2. Update `doc/decisions/README.md` index with links to new ADRs

3. Add "Related ADRs" section to `.plan/.done/{branch-name}/plan.md`

### Step 7: Commit and push ADRs

```bash
git add doc/decisions/ .plan/adr-index.json .plan/.done/
git commit -m "Add ADRs for {feature-name}"
git push origin main
```

## Cleanup Commands

```bash
git fetch origin main && git checkout main && git pull origin main
git branch -d {merged-branch-name}
git push origin --delete {merged-branch-name}
```
